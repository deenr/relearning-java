## **Core Java Basics**
### 1. **Variables and Data Types**
- [x] Learn about primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`).
- [x] Learn about non-primitive data types (`String`, arrays, objects).
- [ ] Practice type conversion and casting.

### 2. **Operators**
- [ ] Learn and practice arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- [ ] Understand relational operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`).
- [ ] Learn logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- [ ] Practice assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.).
- [ ] Learn operator precedence and associativity.

### 3. **Control Flow**
- [ ] Understand and implement `if` statements.
- [ ] Learn and practice `switch` statements.
- [ ] Master `while` loops and `for` loops.
- [ ] Learn nested loops and their use cases.
- [ ] Understand and practice using `break` and `continue` statements.

### 5. **Methods and Functions**
- [ ] Understand method creation and invocation.
- [ ] Learn about method overloading and its importance.
- [ ] Learn the differences between instance and static methods.
- [ ] Practice writing and using recursive methods.

### 6. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts**
- [ ] Learn about classes and objects.
- [ ] Understand the concept of constructors and their use.
- [ ] Practice creating and using objects in Java.
- [ ] Learn about the `this` keyword.

### 7. **Inheritance and Polymorphism**
- [ ] Understand inheritance and the `extends` keyword.
- [ ] Learn about method overriding and the `super` keyword.
- [ ] Understand polymorphism (compile-time and runtime).
- [ ] Practice using interfaces and abstract classes.

---

## **Intermediate Concepts**
### 8. **Exception Handling**
- [ ] Learn how to use `try`, `catch`, `finally` blocks.
- [ ] Understand the importance of exception types (checked vs. unchecked).
- [ ] Practice creating custom exceptions.

### 9. **Java Libraries**
- [ ] Get familiar with the `Math` library for mathematical operations.
- [ ] Explore utility libraries like `java.util` (ArrayList, HashMap, etc.).
- [ ] Learn how to work with file I/O using `File`, `FileWriter`, `FileReader`.

---

## **Advanced Java Topics**
### 10. **Multithreading and Concurrency**
- [ ] Understand the basics of threads and creating them.
- [ ] Learn about synchronization and preventing race conditions.
- [ ] Explore Javaâ€™s `Thread` class and `Runnable` interface.

### 11. **Generics**
- [ ] Learn what generics are and how they provide type safety.
- [ ] Practice creating generic classes and methods.

### 12. **Lambda Expressions and Streams**
- [ ] Understand and use lambda expressions.
- [ ] Learn how to work with Java streams for data manipulation.

---

## **Additional Topics**
### 13. **Java Memory Management**
- [ ] Understand the Java memory model (heap, stack, garbage collection).
- [ ] Learn about `finalize()` and how memory is managed in Java.

### 14. **Java APIs and Frameworks**
