# Relearning Java

## About  
This repository is dedicated to relearning Java with the goal of building a strong foundation to dive into Spring Boot. I studied Java during university, but it's been some time since I last used it, so I'm refreshing my knowledge.

## Goals  
- Revisit core Java concepts (OOP, data structures, exception handling, etc.).  
- Practice Java coding with exercises and mini-projects.  

## Progress  
I'll document key takeaways and code examples as I progress through my relearning journey.
